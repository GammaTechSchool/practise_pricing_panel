**_You can check out the expected outcome of this project [here](https://strong-buttercream-9cddf8.netlify.app/)_**

This exercise allows you to practice and apply the concepts and techniques of CSS taught in class.

## Introduction

We have learned CSS and responsive styling, and it's about time to put it all together in a small project like this.

<br>

## Requirements

- Fork this repo.
- Clone this repo.

<br>

## Instructions

We provide you with the initial HTML code, so you just have to focus on the styles. Don\`t remove or add any HTML unless it is strictly necessary. Use the icons in the `icons` folder in the repo.

Check out the [expected outcome](https://strong-buttercream-9cddf8.netlify.app/) and try to replicate it as much as you can. Watch out: it's responsive!

When you are finished, push your repo and create a `Pull Request` so that we can check your work.

Happy Coding! ❤️
